            <h3>Cheese Filling</h3>
        
            <div class="list">-15 oz. ricotta cheese, 2 cups</div>
            <div class="list">-1 large egg</div>
            <div class="list">-2 cups mozzarella cheese</div>
            <div class="list">-¾ cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</div>
            <div class="list">-2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</div>
            <div class="list">-½ teaspoon salt</div>
            <div class="list">-¼ tsp pepper</div>
        
            <h3>Meat Sauce</h3>
        
            <div class="list">-1 tablespoon olive oil</div>
            <div class="list">-1 yellow onion, finely diced</div>
            <div class="list">-¾ lb. ground beef</div>
            <div class="list">-¾ lb. ground Italian sausage</div>
            <div class="list">-3 cloves garlic, minced</div>
            <div class="list">-½ cup chicken broth</div>
            <div class="list">-40 oz. marinara sauce, see notes</div>
            <div class="list">-1 tablespoon tomato paste</div>
            <div class="list">-1 teaspoon hot sauce</div>
            <div class="list">-1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</div>
        
            <h3>Lasagna Noodles/ Cheese Topping</h3>
        
            <div class="list">-12 lasagna noodles, plus extra in case of breakage</div>
            <div class="list">-2.5 cups mozzarella cheese</div>
        
            <h2>Steps:</h2>
       
        
            <div class="list">-Combine the cheese filling ingredients in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.
                Make the Meat Sauce</div>
            <div class="list">-Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</div>
            <div class="list">-Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</div>
            <div class="list">-Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently while you boil the pasta noodles.</div>
            <h3>Preheat Oven and Cook the Lasagna Noodles</h3>
            <div class="list">-Preheat oven to 375°.</div>
            <div class="list">-Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water for the lasagna noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached, cook the noodles to al dente according to package instructions. (Set a timer to ensure you don’t overcook them.) Gently stir with a wooden spoon throughout cooking to prevent the noodles from sticking. Drain and rinse with cold water until noodles are completely cool.</div>
            <div class="list">-Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper while you begin assembling the lasagna.</div>
            <h3>Assemble the Lasagna</h3>
            <div class="list">-Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch casserole dish. Next, add 4 lasagna noodles, overlapping them if needed.</div>
            <div class="list">-Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by about 1 ½ cups of meat sauce.</div>
            <div class="list">-Top with 4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1 ½ cups meat sauce.</div>
            <div class="list">-Finish with 4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture, and the rest of the meat sauce.</div>
            <div class="list">-Top with 2 ½ cups of Mozzarella cheese.</div>
            <div class="list">-Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray and place it spray-side-down on top of the baking dish to prevent the cheese from sticking to it.</div>
            <h3>Bake</h3>
            <div class="list">-Bake for 35 minutes. Remove cover and bake for 10 more minutes.</div>
            <div class="list">-Remove and garnish with fresh parsley. Let it sit for 15 minutes prior to serving to allow the layers to set. Serve with garlic bread with cheese.</div>
